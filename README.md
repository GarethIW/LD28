Our entry for the 28th Ludum Dare, for the Jam competition.


Building
--------

(Windows)

Requires:
* VS2012 or 2013 (only tested on 2012 but 2013 should be fine)
* XNA Game Studio - can be installed using the [unofficial installers](http://msxna.codeplex.com/releases)
* Font is included in the dependencies dir.

The game can be compiled with either the standard XNA libraries or Monogame, simply by swapping out the references. The main game project currently references the supplied Monogame .dll which is a recent build of the WindowsGL port.
