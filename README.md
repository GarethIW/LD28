Our entry for the 28th Ludum Dare, for the Jam competition.

Repositiory contains a VS2012 solution, which requires XNA GS4 to be installed, as per the instructions [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10881005/how-to-install-xna-game-studio-on-visual-studio-2012)

MonoGame is also required for the Windows OpenGL and Linux projects. The _References folder contains custom-built Monogame libraries to reference in the project.
